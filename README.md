# mest-net

Originally this project supposed to be commercial one, but since its launch didn't happen I make this repository open to show my code in Rust. 

I've implemented Telegram bot that allows users to find and book free seats in nearby restaurants. 

The original idea was to connect people with restaurant managers. People send their location to bot and number of persons, then we sent notifications to all restaurants in circle area. And restaurant managers approve it or reject.

Bot implemented with Teloxide.
